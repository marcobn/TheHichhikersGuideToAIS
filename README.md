## The Hitchhiker's Guide to the All-Interval 12-Tone Rows

*Marco Buongiorno Nardelli*

**Abstract**. This article revisits the generation, classification and categorization of all-intervals 12-tone series (AIS). 
Inspired by the seminal work of Morris and Starr in 1974 (Morris and Starr, The Structure of All-Interval Series 1974), 
it expands their analysis using complex network theory and provides composers and theorists with the re-ordering scheme 
that links all AISs together by chains of relations.

The repository contains high resolution Figure 1, gephi input file for manual exploration of the network, the IPython 
notebook with the code used to generate all the results, the AIS list in prime forms (918 rows) in csv format and the binary data (python pickle) of the 918 prime forms and the full 3856 transpositionally invariant series.
